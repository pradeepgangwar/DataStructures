DST Lab: Section B

Consider a graph with vertices numbered 0 to N, where N is entered by the user. Every vertex stores an integer, which is also supplied by the user. A vertex i is connected to the vertices i-2, i+1, i+2, i+5 and i+10 (if the indices exist).

1.      Represent the graph using adjacency matrix

2.      Represent the graph using adjacency list

3.      For both representations, take two indices from the user and find if an edge exists between the two indices

4.      For both representations, print all the outgoing edges from a vertex i.

5.      For both representations, print all the incoming edges from a vertex i.

6.      Solve the graph using BFS using 0 as the source. Print the shortest path from source to a vertex entered by the user.

7.      Solve the graph using DFS using 0 as the source. Print the shortest path from source to a vertex entered by the user.

8.      Using DFS find the number of disconnected sub-graphs assuming that the graph is undirected.
